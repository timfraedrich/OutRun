"Changelog_1.2.2" = "After receiving a trademark complaint \"OutRun\" will now be called \"Out-Run\" in the UK. This update has the main purpose of addressing this complaint.\n\nAdditionally it contains the following bug fixes:\n\n- sometimes data was not added properly to Apple Health, this should now be fixed\n- ascending and descending altitude were swapped in the statistics, now they are in the right order\n- there have been some style issues because of changes in iOS 14, everything should look normally again\n\nAnd for this update nothing more changed.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out at outrun@tadris.de.\n\nTim, the Developer.";
"Changelog_1.3" = "It has been quite a long time since the last update and while I am still working on some more fundamental changes to OutRun this update also marks a huge step in the evolution of this app.\n\nI am very happy to announce that OutRun will now be available in ELEVEN additional languages which brings us to a total of thirteen and all of that thanks to a few really great people, who can be found in this project's README inside the source-code repository.\n\nOther than that not much has changed in this version:\n\n- There is a new contributor tab in settings, listing all the people who have considerably added to OutRun\n- and the source-code button was moved from 'Support' to 'App-Info'\n\nAnd that is that.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out at outrun@tadris.de.\n\nTim, the Developer.";
